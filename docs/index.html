    <p>
      Selective Disclosure and Unlinkability,
      or Disassociability are privacy and consent
      oriented features of digital credential formats.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to support these features, claims need to be structured or transformed so that cryptographic envelopes
      can be applied.
      Digital credential formats make tradeoffs between size and compute, and also issuance vs presentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This document is meant to give a general sense of these trade offs.
      The implementations under test here have not been optimized for performance and are implemented in javascript.
    </p>

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>
      In order to compare approaches, we need to generate examples
      that can be tested via both Data Integrity Proofs and
      Selective Disclosure JSON Web Tokens.
    </p>
    <p>
      We accomplish this by building on the internationalization examples
      in the W3C Verifiable Credentials Specification.
    </p>
    <p>
      We start with a simplified version of a verifiable credential with support for multiple langauges:
    </p>
    <pre class="example">
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2"
  ],
  "id": "http://university.example/credentials/3732",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "ExampleDegreeCredential"],
  "issuer": {
    "id": "https://university.example/issuers/565049",
    "name": [{
      "value": "Example University",
      "lang": "en"
    }, {
      "value": "Université de Exemple",
      "lang": "fr"
    }, {
      "value": "جامعة المثال",
      "lang": "ar",
      "dir": "rtl"
    }],
  },
  "validFrom": "2015-05-10T12:30:00Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",
    "degree": {
      "type": "ExampleBachelorDegree",
      "subtype": "Bachelor of Science and Arts"
    }
  }
}
    </pre>
    <p>
      From this template we generate examples where the only difference is the number of alternative names. 
      We also compute the input requirements from the example, and mark all names as "disclosable".
    </p>
    <p>
      We then average the execution time of issuance, and compare growth of issuance time for the credential formats to the number of names.
    </p>
